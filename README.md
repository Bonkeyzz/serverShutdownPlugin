# A plugin that shutdowns the server when no one is online after a specified amount of time.

This plugin was created for my private tekkit server.

Tested minecraft versions: `1.6.4 Cauldron (Tekkit server with Bukkit plugin support)`

# Available commands

`/enableautoshutdown <true/false>` -- Toggles this plugin **(Requires /reload for changes to apply)**

You can also change the above variables in the configuration file which is in: `plugins/serverIdlePoweroff/config.yml`
